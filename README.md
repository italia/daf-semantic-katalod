====================

This module is designed to offer support for parsing ontologies and vocabularies, eventually exposing the minimum set of metadata to the other components.

For simplicity it is designed re-using jersey and swagger with jetty, using RDF4J as the main interface to RDF.

NOTE: it's possible to replace maven with sbt
NOTE: we could disable jetty and rewrite the endpoint directly with play!
